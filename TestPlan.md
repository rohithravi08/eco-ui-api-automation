# Test Plan for Third-Party Payment Gateway Integration

## 1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the strategy for testing the integration of a third-party payment gateway into our e-commerce platform. The objective is to ensure seamless functionality, Performance, and user experience.

## 2. Objectives
- Verify successful payment processing through the new gateway.
- Ensure that existing e-commerce functionalities remain unaffected.
- Validate security & Performance testing.

## 3. Testing Scope
- **In-Scope:**
  - Payment processing workflows (credit/debit cards, digital wallets).
  - Transaction status updates (success, failure, refunds).
  - User interface changes related to payment options.
  - Performance testing of new payment gateway 
  - Security and compliance checks.
  
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Changes unrelated to payment processing.
  - Non-functional aspects not related to the payment gateway.

## 4. Test Cases
- **Functional Test Cases:**
  - Verify payment processing for valid card details.
  - Validate error messages for invalid card details.
  - Check transaction status updates after payment.
  
- **Non-Functional Test Cases:**
  - 'x' number of users hit the system in specific time period returns the response in 'y' amount of time (x & y to be discussed with business)
  - Ensure data encryption during payment processing.
  
- **User Experience Test Cases:**
  - Validate UI changes for payment selection.
  - Verify accessibility related tests 

## 5. Environment Details
- **Testing Environment:** 
  - Chose environment based on  
    - production identical resources are available - possible to conduct load testing
    - payment gateway stub available 
  
- **Browser Compatibility:** 
  - Google Chrome (latest version).
  - Firefox (latest version).
  
- **Devices:**
  - Desktop (Windows and macOS).
  - Mobile (iOS and Android).
  
- **Network Conditions:**
  - Simulated network latency for performance testing.
  
- **Access Permissions:**
  - Ensure test accounts with various roles and permissions are set up for comprehensive testing.

## 6. Test Data
- **Payment Information:**
  - Valid credit/debit card numbers for successful transactions.
  - Invalid card numbers for testing error handling.
  - Expired card details for negative test cases.
  
- **User Accounts:**
  - Test user accounts with various roles (admin, customer) to validate permissions and access control.
  - User accounts with different payment methods (e.g., cards, digital wallets).
  
- **Transaction Scenarios:**
  - Data for successful transactions.
  - Data for transaction failures (insufficient funds, network issues).

## 7. Entry Criteria
- Test environment is set up and accessible.
- Test data is prepared and available for use.
- All test cases have been reviewed and approved.
- Relevant stakeholders have signed off on the test plan.

## 8. Exit Criteria
- All critical and high-priority test cases have been executed.
- All identified defects have been logged and assessed.
- Defects have been addressed or documented with a clear plan for resolution.
- Test results have been compiled and shared with stakeholders.

## 9. Handling Changes in Requirements
- **Change Management Process:**
  - Maintain open communication with stakeholders to understand changes and update the test plan accordingly.
  - Use an iterative testing approach to accommodate evolving requirements without delaying the overall project timeline.

## 10. Reporting and Metrics
- Regular updates on testing progress, defect status, and test coverage.
- Use metrics such as defect density and test case pass rate to evaluate quality.
- Create defect dashboard & test results dashboard for visibility

## 11. Conclusion
This test plan serves as a guide for the systematic testing of the payment gateway integration, ensuring alignment with project objectives and effective management of requirements changes.
