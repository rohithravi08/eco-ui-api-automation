# Test Case Prioritization Strategy

## 1. Prioritization Criteria
To effectively prioritize test cases for the third-party payment gateway integration, the following criteria will be applied:

- **Business Impact**: Tests that validate critical payment functionalities like successful transactions and handling payment errors will be executed first.

- **Risk Assessment**: High-risk areas, like security vulnerabilities and response time (load testing) will be prioritized

- **Frequency of Use**: Scenarios representing the most common user interactions like checkout process will be executed earlier to ensure a smooth user experience.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Tests ensuring compliance with legal and security standards will be prioritized to prevent legal issues and maintain customer trust.

## 2. Alignment with Project Objectives
The prioritization strategy will be closely aligned with overall project objectives by focusing on tests that impact user experience and business goals. Regular communication with stakeholders will help refine priorities based on project milestones and feedback.

## 3. Adjusting Prioritization for Requirement Changes
- **Change Impact Analysis**: If requirements change during the testing phase, a rapid assessment will be conducted to evaluate how these changes affect existing test cases and overall project risk.

- **Re-Prioritization**: The test case priorities will be adjusted based on this analysis, focusing on newly introduced functionalities or altered requirements that may affect critical paths.

## 4. Communication with Stakeholders
- **Regular Updates**: Changes in test case prioritization will be communicated during status meetings and through project management tools.

- **Documentation**: The test plan and related documents will be updated to reflect new priorities, ensuring stakeholders are aware of the rationale behind these adjustments.

- **Feedback Loop**: Stakeholder feedback will be encouraged on prioritization changes to ensure alignment with business expectations and project objectives.

## 5. Conclusion
This prioritization strategy will enable efficient and effective testing of the payment gateway feature, ensuring that high-risk and high-impact areas are addressed promptly while maintaining alignment with overall project objectives.
